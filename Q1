Q1)At posedge of clock if signal A is asserted, then in the next cycle signal B should go high & signal C should be stable. The signal C should not change until signal B goes low. Once the Signal B goes low in the same cycle the signal C should change.
Solution:
// Sequence S1: C should be stable for one or more cycles, intersecting with B for one or more
sequence S1;
($stable (c) endsequence
ICO Nycles

//Property ABC: If A rises, then in the next cycle, B should be true, C should be stable,
// followed by the condition specified in S1. After S1, in the next cycle, C should change and B should fall.
property property_A_B_C;
@ (posedge clk)
$rose (a) => b && $stable (c) ##1 S1 ##1 $changed (c) && $fell (b); endproperty
